# Cryptocoin

Web App with enhanced UI|UX sample made with InfernoJS + Brunch + Babel/ES6

## Getting started

* Install (if you don't have them):
    * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
    * [Brunch](http://brunch.io): `npm install -g brunch`
    * Brunch plugins and app dependencies: `npm install`
* Run:
    * `npm start` — watches the project with continuous rebuild. This will also launch HTTP server with [pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history) on port `3333`.
    * `npm run build` — builds minified project for production
* Learn:
    * `public/` dir is fully auto-generated and served by HTTP server.  Write your code in `app/` dir.
    * Place static files you want to be copied from `app/assets/` to `public/`.
